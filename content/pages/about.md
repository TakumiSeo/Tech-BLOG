## Why This Blog Exists
I spend most of my days validating Azure workloads, and I needed a dedicated space to capture the experiments, benchmarking notes, and lessons learned along the way. Every article here is part lab notebook, part field report.

## Topics You Can Expect
- Azure infrastructure verification
- Performance tuning playbooks
- Deployment automation trials (Static Web Apps, Functions, Containers)
- Tooling rundowns, including Pelican customizations
